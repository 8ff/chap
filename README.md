# CHAP: Secure Your Data with Ease

**CHAP** is a versatile tool for encryption, decryption, and secure file wiping. Designed with simplicity and security in mind.
It uses chacha20poly1305 cipher and scrypt [library](https://github.com/8ff/cipherbox).

## Features
- **Encrypt** (`e`): Secure your data with strong encryption. (Requires `CKEY` environment variable)
- **Decrypt** (`d`): Decrypt your data to restore it to its original form. (Requires `CKEY` environment variable)
- **Wipe** (`w`,`wipe`): Permanently and securely erase files, leaving no trace behind.

## Installation
Download the latest release of Carp from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/8ff/carp/releases/tag/latest).

1. Download the binary for your platform.
2. Make it executable:

    ```bash
    chmod +x carp
    ```

3. Run the binary from the download location or place it in your system PATH for easy access.

## Usage

### Encrypting Data
To encrypt a file, ensure the `CKEY` environment variable is set with a 32-byte key. If the key is shorter, it will be padded using a Fibonacci sequence, which is not secure. It is highly recommended to use a key of the correct length.

```bash
CKEY="your-32-byte-key" ./carp e < plaintext.txt > encrypted.txt
```

### Decrypting Data
Decrypt your previously encrypted files with the correct key:

```bash
CKEY="your-32-byte-key" ./carp d < encrypted.txt > plaintext.txt
```

### Securely Wiping Files
To securely delete a file, use the wipe command:

```bash
./carp wipe /path/to/your/file.txt
```
### Dont prompt for confirmation
```bash
FORCE_WIPE=true ./carp wipe /path/to/your/file.txt
```

### Help
For assistance and a summary of available commands:

```bash
./carp help
```

## Key Length Requirement
Your encryption key must be exactly 32 bytes long. If it's shorter, it will be padded using a Fibonacci sequence, which is not recommended for secure encryption. Ensure your key is the correct length to maintain the highest level of security.
